    "## TensorFlow Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire purpose of TensorFlow is to have a so-called computational graph that can be executed much more efficiently than if the same calculations were to be performed directly in Python. TensorFlow can be more efficient than NumPy because TensorFlow knows the entire computation graph that must be executed, while NumPy only knows the computation of a single mathematical operation at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow can also automatically calculate the gradients that are needed to optimize the variables of the graph so as to make the model perform better. This is because the graph is a combination of simple mathematical expressions so the gradient of the entire graph can be calculated using the chain-rule（數學） for derivatives（導數）.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow can also take advantage of multi-core CPUs as well as GPUs - and Google has even built special chips just for TensorFlow which are called TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) and are even faster than GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A TensorFlow graph consists of the following parts which will be detailed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Placeholder variables used to change the input to the graph.\n",
    "* Model variables that are going to be optimized so as to make the model perform better.\n",
    "* The model which is essentially just a mathematical function that calculates some output given the input in the placeholder variables and the model variables.\n",
    "* A cost measure that can be used to guide the optimization of the variables.\n",
    "* An optimization method which updates the variables（phi 沒記錯嗎？整套 W and b） of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the TensorFlow graph may also contain various debugging statements e.g. for logging data to be displayed using TensorBoard, which is not covered in this tutorial."

This is a so-called tensor, which just means that it is a multi-dimensional vector or matrix. The data-type is set to `float32` and the shape is set to `[None, img_size_flat]`, where `None` means that the tensor may hold an arbitrary number of images with each image being a vector of length `img_size_flat`."

As demonstrated below, some of the mis-classifications are justified because the images are very hard to determine with certainty even for humans, while others are quite obvious and should have been classified correctly by a good model. But this simple model cannot reach much better performance and more complex models are therefore needed."
